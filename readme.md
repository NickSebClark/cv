expertise in Python and LabVIEW. Experienced in undertaking and
completing complex projects involving data science, analysis and
collection. A strong background in engineering and academia. Can adapt
quickly to unfamiliar and demanding technical challenges.

## Employment

Jan 2025 - Present | **Magdrive**\
Senior Electrical Engineer*

Primary responsibility to build test systems.  

May 2018 - Jan 2025 | **YASA**\
*Lead Technical Specialist - Innovation Software*

Leading a team in the innovation group developing software (Python and
MATLAB) for our motor design toolchain. Developed new process
execution architecture built on MySQL Document Store. Lead project to
professionalise software development at YASA and introduce GitLab CI.

*Senior Technical Specialist - Control and Analysis*

Lead project to develop dynamometer control and data acquisition
software including a MySQL data management back-end.

*Control and Analysis Engineer*

Lead developer for data acquisition and analysis software for YASA's
first serial production End-Of-Line tester.

Sept 2017 - Apr 2018 | **Sharp Laboratories of Europe**\
*Research Scientist*

Leading development of touch sensors for OLED displays. A new touch
sensor design was researched, proposed and simulated before a
prototype was designed and tested.

Apr 2017 - Aug 2017 | **Cardiff University**\
*Research Associate*

Hardware and software development of a precision microwave heating
system. A bespoke mixed signal PCB with embedded control was developed
to act as a microwave source. A complete and robust system was
presented to enable further research and ongoing cross disciplinary activity.

Sep 2011 - Sep 2012 | **National Instruments UK**\
*Applications Engineer*

An internship involving providing support for all of NI's extensive
product range. Led training in advanced LabVIEW topics and produced
several prototypes and proof-of-concept projects for customers.

Jul 2010 - Sep 2010 | **Avalon Sciences, Somerset**\
*Junior Electronics Design Engineer*

A new current sensing product, using an embedded microprocessor, was
developed. A bespoke PCB was designed (Altium Designer) and
manufactured.

## Education

2013 - Mar 2017 | **Cardiff University, Centre for High Frequency
Engineering**\
*PhD: Microwave Methods for Additive Layer Manufacturing*

Research involved the design, manufacture and test of microwave based
sensor devices for the additive layer industry in partnership with
Renishaw plc. Resonant cavity based sensors for both metallic powder
characterisation and metal surfaces were completed. Work included
building test systems in LabVIEW, data analysis in Matlab, modelling
of sensor systems and the development of RF test electronics. The work
resulted in the filing of a patent and several academic publications.

2009 - 2013 | **Cardiff University**\
*BEng Computer Systems Engineering, 1st*

Final year project involved the development of a complete amplifier
test system based upon NI USRP and was a finalist in the NI student
design competition. Awarded the Page Fund prize for final year
performance.
